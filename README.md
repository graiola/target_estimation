Estimate the pose of incoming targets through kalman filtering.

# Compilation

# ToDo

- [x] Cleanup the matlab scripts and add the freq
- [ ] Add sigma to the tests/plots
- [ ] Export intersection with the ros target manager
- [ ] Add transformation from target to observer in the yaml (so that the projectile has the z oriented with the world frame for example)
- [ ] Add MKF
